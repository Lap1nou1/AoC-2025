# Advent of Code 2025
My solutions for Advent of Code 2025.

I try to do them all in Rust (and most importantly to do them at all).

You have to import the right day at the beginning of `src/main.rs` and change
filename to where your input is.
(I might one day update my base code because it's not very efficient right now).

The global structure for the files was stolen to Patato.
